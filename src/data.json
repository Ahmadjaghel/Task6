Look closely and you will see that some product images settle to the margins, while others do not. Breaking the grid like this makes it challenging to focus or quickly scan product images and calls more attention to some products over others. It is okay to break the grid every so often, as long as you have a valid reason for it.",

    "des": "A grid system is a design tool used to arrange content on a webpage. It is a series of vertical and horizontal lines that create a matrix of intersecting points, which can be used to align and organize page elements. Grid systems are used to create a consistent look and feel across a website, and can help to make the layout more visually appealing and easier to navigate.",

At desktop screen size, two main columns make up the hierarchical grid. The most important news story takes up the most space in the grid, the left column, followed by secondary and tertiary stories, which take up the smaller column and modules on the right.",

At this screen size, four consistently sized columns make up the grid structure and elements are aligned to and within these columns. The gutters, the spaces in between the columns, are also consistently sized and help the user visually separate the different products. The margins are independently sized and are the same between the left and right sides.",
